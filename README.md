# Genotype-phenotype mapping of natural variation in S. cerevisae.

In this project, we investigate the associations between the phenotypes and genotypes in a natural yeast population. We have gathered >200 phenotypes from various studies for 1011 cerevisiae strains. The data for all phenotypes along with the metdata of the strains and the phenotypes is in the folder 'Phenotypic_data'.
Further, we performed GWAS on all phenotypes using only the Euploid/diploid strains in the collection. The GWAS results for all the pehnotypes are in the folder 'GWAS_results'.
